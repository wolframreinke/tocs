Summary			This document describes the procedure of handling a connection to a user/player of
				the TOCS-Server (TOCS: Text-only Counter Strike). It describes the flow from the 
				view of one connection.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

User connects to Server.

Server creates new <Connection>-Object in a new <Thread> to serve the user.
Afterwards it continues listening.

<Connection> requests information that is necessary for a valid initialisation.
	- Server password, if the server is secured by a password. This feature is not mandority yet and 
	  will be implemented later
	- The desired nickname that will be displayed to other players and used to identify the player. 
	  This name needs to be validated as the player might choose a hard-to-type nickname which is 
	  kind of cheating.
	- The desired team (terrorists, counter-terrorists or auto-assignment)

<Connection> sends the player to the lobby subsystem. The player can choose its skin (no mandority 
feature) and equipment (maybe also the spawn point, but this is not Battlefield). When the player 
finished its configurations, he/she can switch to "ready".
The second player who reaches the lobby starts a countdown from 2 mins.

When the countdown is over or all players switched to "ready", the game launches. The last 10 
seconds of the countdown are printed to every player in the lobby.

The player leaves the lobby and is placed at the spawnpoint on the map.

When the player enters an instruction, the <Connection> delegates the string to the instruction 
interpreter, which will perform basic replacements and evaluations and eventually delegate it to the 
parser chain. Finally the parsed instruction will be applied.

When the player dies or gets damage, he will be notified by a appropriate console output. A death 
player is send back into the lobby, switched to "not ready". Additionally he looses all of his 
equipment.

The only game mode available is "bomb defusion". When the player places a bomb, a countdown from 
1 min is started and all participating players on the map are notified.

When the player defuses the terrorists bomb successfully (which will take about 5 seconds, players 
in the same room are notified) the game ends and all players on the map are send back to the lobby 
and a new 2 mins countdown is started. The counter-terrorists team gains $1000, the terrorists team 
gains $200.

When bomb detonates, all players in the same room are killed and the game ends. All remaining 
players are sent back to the lobby and a new 2 mins countdown is started. The terrorists team gains 
$1000, the terrorists team gains $200.

When all players left the lobby and cancelled thier <Connection>s, the 2 mins countdown is stopped 
and not restarted until another two players enter the lobby again.
